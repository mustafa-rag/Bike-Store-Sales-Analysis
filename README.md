# Bike Store Sales Analysis
## Project Background
The bike store operates in a competitive retail environment in six different countries where customer preferences, seasonal demand, and product profitability directly affect business performance. With a wide range of products — including bicycles, accessories, Clothing and maintenance items — the management team needed a clearer understanding of:

- Which products and categories drive the most sales and profit.  
- How customer demographics (age, gender) influence purchasing behavior.  
- Which geographic markets are most profitable.  
- How seasonality impacts demand and revenue.
